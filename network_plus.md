# OSI Model
-  Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model. Unique protocols at every layer.
-  Mnemonic: "All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

### Layers
7: Application  
6: Presentation  
5: Session  
4: Transport  
3: Network  
2: Data-link  
1: Physical  

### Layer 1: Physical
Concerned with signaling, cabling, connectors (no protocols) - check connections, swap adapter cards
Working with : physical cable, looking at EM transmission across wireless

### Layer 2: Data-link
Data Link Control (DLC) protocols / switching layer
- MAC (Media Access Control) address on Ethernet : communication between cards
Working with : Switch forwarding, MAC addresses

### Layer 3: Network
Routing layer - layer associated with IP addresses
Unit of communication : Frame 

### Layer 4: Transport
Post office layer - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### Layer 5: Session Layer
Communication Management between devices - start, stop, restart  
Control protocols, tunneling protocols

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Encryption/decryption
Character encoding

### Layer 7:
